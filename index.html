    <h1>EE-REID: A Tutorial on Easy and Efficient Re-identification</h1>
    <p><strong>Proposed by:</strong> Lamarr Institute for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Germany</p>
    <p><strong>Contact:</strong> simon.kluettermann@cs.tu-dortmund.de</p>
    <p><strong>Proposed for:</strong> WACV 2025, Half-day Event</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>We propose a tutorial for the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, presenting our Python library <strong>EE-REID</strong>. 
    The library enables novice researchers to easily perform re-identification experiments. 
    The tutorial will be structured as a half-day event, featuring hands-on tasks using Google Colab notebooks. 
    Attendees will work on three training tasks of increasing complexity, assisted by the presenters.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>Re-identification is a growing field in machine learning. Our library, EE-REID, simplifies the setup of re-identification pipelines, making it accessible even to non-experts. 
    The tutorial will introduce the library, guide participants through training tasks, and cover various re-identification challenges, including Graph Neural Networks and Novelty Detection.</p>

    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>This tutorial is intended for graduate students, young researchers, and computer scientists with an interest in computer vision and machine learning. We anticipate 20 to 40 attendees, but we can scale it accordingly.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="materials-resources">
    <h2>Materials and Resources</h2>
    <p>
        During the tutorial, we plan to use a series of interactive Google Colab notebooks to demonstrate key concepts and techniques. 
        These notebooks will be available to attendees for hands-on practice and experimentation, covering different re-identification applications, 
        as well as more advanced concepts like novelty detection, graph re-identification, and ensemble methods. 
        All materials will remain accessible after the tutorial for further study and exploration.

    <h2>Relation to Similar Tutorials and Workshops</h2>
    <p>
        Re-identification is a prominent topic and often appears in tutorials at major conferences, typically focusing on broader topics like contrastive learning 
        or self-supervised representation learning. Relevant examples include 
        <a href="https://gidariss.github.io/self-supervised-learning-cvpr2021/">CVPR 2021: Leave those Nets alone: Advances in Self-Supervised Learning</a>, 
        <a href="https://feichtenhofer.github.io/eccv2022-ssl-tutorial/">ECCV 2022: Self-Supervised Representation Learning in Computer Vision</a>, 
        and <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2021/tutorial/21895">NeurIPS 2021: Self-Supervised Learning: Self-Prediction and Contrastive Learning</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, many tutorials focus on the use of various open-source libraries. Examples include 
        <a href="https://iccv2023.thecvf.com/list.of.accepted.tutorials-91.php">ICCV 2023: OpenMMLab: Open-source Platform for Vision, Language, and Generative AI</a>,

</div>

<div class="section" id="social-impact">
    <h2>Social Impact of the Tutorial</h2>
    <p>
        Conducting effective and reliable re-identification experiments can be challenging due to model complexity, dataset variability, 
        and the complexities of algorithm selection and tuning. To address these issues, we developed <code>EE-REID</code> to make this 
        process more accessible to non-experts. This tutorial aims to highlight the library’s potential to increase inclusivity 
        within this research domain, broadening participation and reducing entry barriers for those interested in re-identification research.
